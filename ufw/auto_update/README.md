# Auto Update Allow Rules in ufw (uncomplicated firewall)

## Goal of this script

This script can be used to regulary update Allow Rules via auto replace or adding new rules to ufw.

## Usecase

I use this script to permanently update my access rules regarding a dyndns Entry for my dynamic IP at Home.
That gives the possibilty to explicitly only allow to access the defined ports only via my Home Internet Connection.
